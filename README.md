## Doctypes

### Employee Checkin

Each employee should have an Attendance ID mapped to the biometric/RFID devices' user IDs. Devices send check-in/out logs to the Employee Checkin doctype. 

There's a need for Checkin/Checkout logs, mostly fetched from a biometric system (e.g. https://github.com/navariltd/navari-frappehr-biostar) created under [employee checkin](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/employee_checkin), every day.


### Attendance

Tracks the attendance status of employees (Present, Absent, On Leave, etc.) based on Employee Checkin records.
Attendance is marked as per the shifts assigned to each employee. This happens automatically for every shift type with *Enable Auto Attendance* checked.
Overtime timesheets are generated, from the attendance data. Happens automatically, one can also choose to generate these manually from the [timesheet center.](#Timesheet_Center)


### Activity Type

Defines the different types of activities i.e.
- **Overtime 1.5**: Additional time (more than 30 minutes) past an employee's shift end time.
- **Overtime 2.0**: Attendance on a holiday listed for the employee.

**NB:** *Overtime 1.5 Activity* and *Overtime 2.0 Activity* should be different so as to differentiate between the two types of overtime.

### Timesheet Center

Serves as a hub for managing overtime generation from employee attendance records.
### Overtime Generation Process

To generate the overtime timesheets:
1. Select the start and end dates for which you want to generate timesheets.
2. Save the document.
3. Click on the **Generate Timesheets** button, which will then get employees who have worked extra hours. This will be recorded under the Timesheet doctype.


### Timesheet

Records the details of overtime hours worked by employees.

### Navari Custom Payroll Settings
This doctype includes settings related to payroll:
- **Maximum monthly hours**: Hours beyond this are carried over to overtime when creating salary slips.
- **Overtime 1.5 Activity**: Specifies the activity type for regular overtime.
- **Overtime 2.0 Activity**: Specifies the activity type for holiday overtime.
- **Include early entry**: Determines whether hours before shift start time are included in payroll calculations.
- **Overtime Threshold**: The number of minutes/hours after shift end time for overtime to be considered.

## Matching Attendance to Payroll

### Steps

1. **Create an [Employee](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/employee)**: Ensure each employee is properly set up in the system.
2. **Create [Salary Components](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/salary-component)**: Define the various salary components such as basic salary, allowances, and deductions.
3. **Create a [Salary Structure](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/salary-structure)**: Develop a salary structure that includes all salary components.
4. **Create a [Salary Structure Assignment](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/salary-structure-assignment)**: Assign the salary structure to each employee.
5. **Create a [Payroll Entry](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/payroll-entry)**: Generate payroll entries for each payroll period.
6. **Generate [Salary Slips](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/salary-slip)**: Create salary slips for each employee, incorporating attendance and overtime data.

## Payroll Generation

### Steps for Payroll Generation

1. **Attendance Data**: Ensure that attendance data is accurately logged and verified in the [Attendance](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/attendance) doctype.
2. **Generate Overtime Timesheets**: Automatically or manually generate timesheets for overtime using the Timesheet Center for the specified payroll period.
![Timesheet Center](https://github.com/navariltd/nl-attendance-timesheet/assets/60260520/908523fc-7961-4064-916d-55e65adbd649)
3. **Submit Timesheets**: Submit timesheets to ensure they are included in payroll calculations.
![Submitted Timesheet](https://github.com/navariltd/nl-attendance-timesheet/assets/60260520/72ddcc6d-e028-4b4b-b5d3-d65131c574b4)
4. **Create Payroll Entry**: Create a payroll entry for the desired payroll period.
![Payroll Entry](https://github.com/navariltd/nl-attendance-timesheet/assets/60260520/8feb26ea-d3f3-426b-bd12-075a27dc2625)
5. **Generate Salary Slips**: Generate salary slips, which will incorporate attendance and timesheet records under the attendance tab in the salary slip, ensuring accurate calculation of regular and overtime pay.

***Few changes to the payroll process:***
1. When creating a salary structure for employees who are paid per hour, make sure to check the *Wage based salary (hours)* field, and fill the *Hour Rate* and *Salary Component* fields.
2. When running payroll on payroll entry, after generating salary slips, attendance data is fetched and added to employees attendance in the salary slips. Attendance data will be picked from [attendance](https://frappehr.com/docs/v14/en/attendance) and timesheet records generated over that payroll period.
![Attendance Details Tab](https://github.com/navariltd/nl-attendance-timesheet/assets/60260520/885be677-0406-4496-8691-894a97cb5f3d)

3. Attendance data will be added to the *Attendance Details* tab on a salary slip.
![Worked Hours Summary Section](https://github.com/navariltd/nl-attendance-timesheet/assets/60260520/80c468ba-4b44-48a4-ac6d-63deaf5fae86)

4. **Regular Working Hours:** Sum of *Billiable Hours* from the *Attendance* table. Hours beyond what is set as *Maximum monthly hours* on *Navari Custom Payroll Settings* are carried over to the *Overtime Hours* field.<br>
5. **Overtime Hours:** Sum of hours from *Overtime 1.5* table plus what has been carried over from *Regular Working Hours*, incase there is anything to carry over.<br>
6. **Holiday hours:** Sum of hours from *Overtime 2.0* table.<br>
7. **Hourly Rate:** Fetched from the salary structure assigned to an employee. Used to calculate basic and overtime pay (Both regular and holiday overtime)<br>
```Basic salary = (hourly_rate * regular_working_hours)``` <br>
```OT hours = hourly_rate * 1.5 * overtime_hours``` <br>
```Holiday Hours = hourly_rate * 2 * holiday_hours```<br>
*NB: OT here refers to regular overtime*<br>
